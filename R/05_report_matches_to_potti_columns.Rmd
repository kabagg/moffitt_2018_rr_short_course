# Executive Summary

## Introduction

In 2006, [Potti et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm1491) 
claimed to have found a way to use microarray profiles of a specific 
panel of cell lines (the NCI60) to predict cancer patient response 
to chemotherapeutics from a similar profile of the patient's tumor. 
Using different subsets of cell lines, they made predictions for several 
different drugs. We wanted to apply their method, so we asked
them to send us lists of which cell lines were used to make
predictions for which drugs. The method doesn't work; we 
describe our full analyses 
[here](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1267453942).

The first dataset (an expression matrix with genes in rows and 
samples in columns) we received from Potti et al didn't have the
cell lines labeled; for each column we could tell which drug
it was supposed to be associated with, and whether it was in 
contrast group "0" or "1". We want to see if we can identify where the 
numbers came from and see if there were any oddities that should
have raised red flags early on.

## Data and Methods

We examined 3 datasets:

* The data table from Potti et al, available at
* Gene expression values from microarray profiling (in triplicate)
  of the NCI60 cell lines by Novartis, at the individual replicate
  level, available from URL as FILENAME
* Gene expression values from microarray profiling of tumors from 
  24 breast cancer patients treated with single agent docetaxel,
  split into those who did and did not respond to treatment
  available, available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
  as GSE349 (resistant), URL, and GSE350 (sensitive), URL. This
  cohort was used by Potti et al to validate their predictions 
  for docetaxel. 
  
All of these datasets involve measurements from Affymetrix U-95A
or U-95Av2 gene chips, which give measurements on 12625 probesets,
of which 67 are controls and 12558 correspond to genes. 

The initial Potti data matrix is 12558 by 134; there are no labeled
rows for the control probes. The first probeset listed is 36460\_at.

The NCI60 data matrix is 12625 by 180;
the 59 cell lines in the panel were mostly run in triplicate, but a 
few were run 2 or 4 times. Replicates were labeled A, B, C, or D as
appropriate. As with the Potti et al data matrix, the first listed
probeset is 36460\_at.

The GEO data matrix is 12625 by 24. Values are reported first for
the control probes and then for the genes; the probeset ordering 
is different than that in the NCI60 dataset.

We first examined the raw datasets for basic dimensions and signs 
of structure, after which we processed the datasets to put each in 
the form of gene by sample expression matrices with row and column
names and associated data frames of sample and/or gene annotation, 
as available. We then tried matching the expression values for
specific probesets to see if we could identify replicate columns 
within a dataset (e.g., cell lines used to supply information 
about more than one drug) or between datasets to identify cell 
lines by matching the unlabeled columns in the Potti dataset with 
annotation information in the other datasets. We also checked 
correlations within and between datasets to see what the range 
of concordance was. 
  
All analysis R and Rmd files are stored in R/.  
  
## Results

Expression values were reported to 6 decimal places, so exact
matching gave a shortcut means of identification. Checking all 
values of 36460\_at in the Potti et al dataset against the NCI60 
data matrix gave precise identifications for all of the cell lines
used for 5 of the 7 drugs investigated; in all cases the "A" replicate
values were used. We found no matches for any of the columns provided
for Docetaxel or Cytoxan (20 columns each) in the Potti et al dataset. 

Checking pairwise correlations within the Potti dataset showed
reasonable positive correlations for all pairs of samples for
which we'd found a match (expected, as many genes perform the 
basic functions of cellular maintenance regardless of background),
but correlations between the matched columns and those for Docetaxel
and Cytoxan were starkly different, all being around 0. Correlations
within the Docetaxel and Cytoxan columns were again positive, and
indeed showed the two sets of columns were identical modulo swapping
of contrast group labels - the 10 cell lines labeled as belonging to 
group "0" for Docetaxel were the same as those comprising group "1"
for Cytoxan, and vice versa. 

Examination of the minimum values of the Docetaxel and Cytoxan 
columns showed these were all tied at 5.89822, whereas the minimums
for all other data columns were much smaller. Since our earlier
skims of the data from GEO (which had been processed differently
than the NCI60 data) had also showed tied minimum values of 5.89822, 
we checked for matches between the Docetaxel/Cytoxan columns and 
the GEO columns. Starting with row 68 in the GEO dataset (right
after the control probes), we found matches for all of the Docetaxel
and Cytoxan columns with values listed _in the order in which they
were provided at GEO_. This matching was exact for 12535 rows; the
remaining 23 still had the GEO values but in a slightly different 
order. Since the probeset orders were different between the NCI and
GEO datasets, this effectively produced a random scrambling of 
the gene values between the two datasets, for which we would
expect the correlation to be 0.

We produced a table mapping each column of the Potti et al dataset
to its corresponding NCI60 or GEO sample in 
[results/potti_matches.csv](`r here("results", "potti_matches.csv")`).

## Conclusions

Given the table we received from Potti et al, we can infer 
which cell lines were used in each contrast group for 5 of the 
7 drugs examined. We can't easily say whether contrast group
0 should correspond to sensitive and 1 to resistant or the
converse from the data supplied. 

The matches we find for Docetaxel and Cytoxan to values in 
the Docetaxel test set make us uneasy. Combining training 
and test data in a single data matrix can readily lead to 
confusion, and we see no reason why the test data should be
here, let alone also be present for Cytoxan. We also don't 
understand why the Docetaxel and Cytoxan columns should be 
mirror images of each other. 

# Data Gathering

Harvesting data from the web is described in 
[results/01_gather_data.md](`r here("results", "01_gather_data.md")`).

The raw data files chemo.zip, WEB\_DATA\_NOVARTIS\_ALL.ZIP, 
GSE349\_family.soft.gz, and GSE350\_family.soft.gz are 
stored in [data/](`r here("data")`).

# Data Exploration

Initial examination of the raw data supplied is described in 
[results/02_describing_raw_data.md](`r here("results", "02_describing_raw_data.md")`).

We note the common ordering of the initial probesets between
the Potti et al and NCI60 datasets, note that the level of
precision in reporting should let matches serve as unique 
identifiers, and confirm the existence of at least one such 
match. 

We note the NCI60 data table initially involves more rows
than would be expected from 180 arrays, suggesting some
duplication which would need to be removed. We also note
that information about which replicate array (A, B, C, or D)
a given value came from is only present in a column also 
listing a gene cluster (GD) identifier for the gene being
measured, thus combining sample (replicate) and gene information. 

We note the GEO data probesets are differently ordered
than the NCI60 ones, and note the presence of tied values, 
particularly at the value of 5.89822. This corresponds to 
the minimum value per column, which should map to essentially
no expression of that gene. 

# Data Preprocessing

Reorganization of the raw data into expression matrices 
and annotation data frames is described in 
[results/03_preprocessing_data_base_r_version.md](`r here("results", "03_preprocessing_data_base_r_version.md")`).

We store the reorganized data from each dataset in RData files
in results/: potti\_data.RData, nci60\_data.RData, and
geo\_data.RData, respectively. 

# Checking Column Matches

Identification of column matches is described in 
[results/04_check_sample_matches_and_corrs.md](`r here("results", "04_check_sample_matches_and_corrs.md")`).

Correlations between pairs of columns in the Potti et al 
dataset show clear bifurcations at the boundaries between
the columns for Docetaxel and Cytoxan and the rest. 

![Potti et al pairwise correlations](`r here("results", "04_check_sample_matches_and_corrs_files", "figure-markdown_github", "plot_raw_potti_cors-1.png")`)

Checking the sample minimums also highlights the discordance,
while also showing that the minimum values in the problematic
columns are coming in at 5.89822, which we previously saw to 
be the minimum of the data columns from GEO. 

![Potti et al pairwise correlations](`r here("results", "04_check_sample_matches_and_corrs_files", "figure-markdown_github", "plot_potti_minimums-1.png")`)

Checking the number of exact matches between the values in 
the Docetaxel columns in the Potti et al dataset (which are
the same as the columns reported for Cytoxan as well) with
the data values from GEO using the ordering from GEO shows
perfect fits for 12535 of 12558 values for each sample; the 
last 23 GEO rows also match the last 23 values in the Potti
et al columns, but not in linear order.
